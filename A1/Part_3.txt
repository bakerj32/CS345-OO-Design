It might be possible to add characters to an existing Small_String_Impl via concatenation. Using the length attribute of the small impl you can use it to make sure that the small impls length plus the length of the new string is less than the max size for a small string impl. If it is, you can use direct string concatenation on the embedded string for the small impl. You would then increment the Length property by the length of the newly concatenated string to make sure the attribute is properly maintained.
